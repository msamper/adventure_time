Rather than seeing the shimmering scales \nthat dragons are known for and hearing the deep breathing of a dragon, you see the color of \ncold steel and hear the clinking of metal on metal as the giant creature moves toward you. This \nwas not a dragon, this was a machine made to look like one. You don’t have much time to think \nhowever as the dragon then immediately attacks you.\n",
  "The machine falls to the ground with a loud mechanical clang. Oil being sprayed all over \nthe cave and gears being discarded all over the area. You see the machine start to catch fire \nand realizing the the oil would soon catch, sprint from the cave. As you make it outside you hear \na loud explosion, knocking you to the ground and causing you to roll a few yards down the \nmountain. Although unsure as to the machine’s nature, you defeated it nevertheless. You \nstart your journey for the capital city to claim the bounty from the king.\n",
  "After a few days journey you make it to the castle. Just before the castle gates you \nencounter Tomas again. He asks you if you will ally with him.\n\t1: Yes\n\t2: No",
  "You tell him that you will ally with him and tell him about the dragon’s mechanical nature. \nThis seems to greatly concern Tomas who then says, \"You’re in danger, keep an eye on me \nonce we get in there.\" ",
  "Ok, I understand.” Tomas then runs off.",
  "You then get to the gates and after showing them your bounty letter they let you through. \nYou enter into the throne room. The room is filled with intricate wall murals and more gold than \nyou’ve ever seen in your life.\n\nAs you approach the King, he speaks first. He calls for everyone else to leave the room. As they \nfile out, the person from the camp gives you a concerned glance. Once the doors close and \njust the king and yourself remain, he states,” I wanted to congratulate you on your \nachievement of defeating the dragon. I never thought anyone would be able to defeat my \nmachine.” Astonished at the implications of what the king had just said you prepare yourself \nfor the worst.\n\nThe king continues, \"You see that miserable town of Samperville had recently developed \nsome democratic tendencies, and I found it necessary to create a way to protect my own \ninterests. I offer you a choice though. Join me and receive all the glory of the nobility or \noppose me and die. It is up to you.\" You notice Tomas has quietly slipped into the room.\n\n",
  "What would you like to do?\n\t1: Join the King in ruling the land\n\t2: Call out to Tomas for help\n\n",
  "Before you can say anything, Tomas and 6 others run into the room. You recognize them \nas Sanaz Gheibi, Luis Carbonell, Maxwell Fresonke, Franky Liang,Trevor Yovaish and Scott Liu.\n\n",
  "\"WAIT! That thing is not King Jonathan! It is merely a duplicate!\"\nThe king attacks you but hardly stands a chance as he is unarmed.\n\n",
  "As you defeat him you, he falls to the ground with a heavy thud, not the sound a human \nwould make. Upon further inspection you realize that whatever just attacked you is purely a \nmachine just like the dragon. Just after this, A man who you looked just like the machine you \njust defeated although he is dressed in rags.\n\n",
  "The man addresses you, \"My name is King Jonathan, that thing is a machine of my own \ncreation. I made the dragon and that machine for purely experimental purposes, using my \nrenowned programming skill. However, my own creations turned on me, locking me away for \nover a year.\"",
  "The king walks over, taking his kingly robes back from the machine. You are truly a hero \nand will be rewarded with double whatever you were promised. I would have you as a member \nof mine own nobility if you would accept. I understand if you’d rather return to your \nhome though.\n\n",
  "What would you like to do?\n\t1: Accept the offer\n\t2: Return home\n\n",
  "\"Excellent! We will have a house built for you in the capital immediately. It will be good to have you.\"\n\nYou become a member of the king’s nobility and enjoy all the benefits of it. You invite your old \nfamily friend to live with you and he sets up a very successful store in the capital. You are free \nto do whatever you please.\n",
  "\"I understand. I wish you the best of luck!\"\n\nYou return home and are paraded through town as a hero upon your return. Your renown \ncauses many people to flock to your town, increasing business and causing your family \nfriend’s business to flourish. You are free to do whatever you please.\n",
  "\"Most excellent, Here is your bounty and I’m sure we can find room for you in our court. \nGUARDS!\" He calls in the guards and they take away Tomas. \"Well it looks like room has just \nbeen vacated. You will enjoy all the luxuries of the nobility until your death.\"\n\n\nYou are made a member of the king’s nobility and are exalted as his closest advisor. You are \ngiven a home in the capital and help the king consolidate his power over the region. The \nnobility continue to flourish at the expense of the people. You are free to do whatever you please.\n",
  "You call out for help from the person and they rush to your side. The king calls for the \nguards and you both are quickly outnumbered. You are surrounded and are unable to flee.\n\"We’ll each take half, they don’t stand a chance\"\n",
  "As you defeat the guards the king surrenders as he knows he stands no chance against \nyou. Tomas then addresses you, \"While you know me as a member of this country’s nobility I \nam actually a spy from the country of Java. We heard that the king here was suppressing \ndemocracy and I was sent to investigate. Once my country receives word of the king’s surrender \nthey will move in to assist with the transition to democracy. I can’t thank you enough for your \nhelp. You are still entitled to that bounty by the way.\" ",
  "After this you return to your hometown. You are paraded through town as a hero upon \nyour return. Your renown causes many people to flock to your town, increasing business and \ncausing your family friend’s business to flourish. You are free to do whatever you please.\n"
